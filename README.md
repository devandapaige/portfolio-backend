# Personal Portfolio

My personal web development portfolio to be hosted at amanda-nelson.com

## Workflow:

1. Used `npx create-react-app .` to set up blank React app and deleted some of the default content and website name and meta tags.
2. Created a mood board (in assets folder) and [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/portfolio-Srh76YpHunCeGpuhNF47jY@2Ux7TurymN91vtafjqjY) to break down what the site will look like and what components are needed.
3. Created a `Components` folder with the following components per the wireframe: `Header, About, ProjectsSection, ProjectCard, Skills, Contact, Footer`.
4. Created a draft within each new component to get the content needed onto the website. The App.js component was updated with the imported components.
5. Drafted out a simple backend to hold my projects for the ProjectsSection & ProjectCard components.
6. Formatted the application to add a backend that will simultaneously deploy with Heroku.
7. Created my first migration with a simple backend using node-postgres per the note in my [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/portfolio-Srh76YpHunCeGpuhNF47jY@2Ux7TurymN91vtafjqjY) of three tables.
